Hello, I'm honestly intrigued that you decided to look at this repository. If your a bit confused, this repository is pretty much just me playing around, and learning python. I'm assuming if your here you are looking at my work to see how skilled I am. I will tell you, I'm not good with python, the language that I'm good at is GML (GameMaker Language).
